            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>
              I recently attended Punchcode, which is a 12 week immersive, in
              person coding bootcamp in Las Vegas. I learned quite a lot. We
              focused on front end web development. I completed projects with
              Html5, CSS3, Javascript, React, and Redux. We also learned several
              back end technologies. I completed projects with express, Node.js,
              and socket.io. Some of our projects required databases which we
              built with mySQL.
            </p>

            <p>
              I felt drawn to become a software developer because, while I
              enjoyed being a successful realtor, I wanted to challenge myself
              and have a career where I could solve problems and learn in an
              ever-changing landscape.
            </p>
            <h3>Real Estate vs Software Development</h3>
            <p>
              Prior to attending Punchcode, most of my professional experience
              was in real estate sales. While this may seem vastly different
              from web development, and it some ways it is, I have found quite a
              lot of common ground between my previous career and web
              development. Here are a few of the similarites I have found:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Top real estate agents all refer to their database of clients
                and leads as the lifeblood of their business. As a realtor, the
                most important activities I conducted were to systematically
                work with my databse using Customer Relationship Management
                software such as Top Producer and Liondesk. Thus, like many
                modern careers, the bulk of a real estate agent's time is spent
                in front of a computer working on organizing tasks and solving
                problems.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                One of most important skills in real estate is managing customer
                expectations and eduacting customers about what is realistic in
                the current market. Sellers frequently want to list their home
                for more than it is worth and buyers frequently expect to get
                more features and a better location than their budget allows.
                Customer service in real estate is all about understanding
                clients' needs, respectfully educating them about what is
                feasible, and guiding them to a positive resolution they end up
                being very happy with in the end. This process is very similar
                to what I expect to encounter in developing software to meet
                customer needs.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                The process of managing the workflow of a real estate
                transaction is very similar to tackling issues or tickets in a
                software project. As a realtor I used Kanban style system to
                keep track of critical deadlines and milestones in each
                transaction. Meeting customer due diligence deadlines, keeping
                track of appraisal and loan contingency deadlines as well as
                ordering appraisal and inspection reports, scheduling payment
                for multiple transactions all require diligent organization. I
                feel that these activities have prepared me very well for
                developing software in an Agile or Kanban oriented system and
                meeting sprint goals while communicating what activities I have
                been working on.
